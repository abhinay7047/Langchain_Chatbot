1. Compile all relevant receipts and documentation related to the lunch expense, including the date, amount spent, and purpose of the expense.

2. Reach out to your company's finance or accounting department to inquire about the reimbursement process and any specific forms or procedures that need to be followed.

3. Submit a formal reimbursement request, including all supporting documents, to the appropriate channels within your company.

4. Follow up with the responsible party to ensure that your request is being processed and inquire about the timeline for receiving the reimbursement.

By following these steps and maintaining clear communication with the relevant department, you should be able to successfully claim your reimbursement for the lunch expenses incurred during the meeting. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to provide more details so I can offer more tailored guidance.
